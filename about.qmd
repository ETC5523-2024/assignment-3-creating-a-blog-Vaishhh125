## Vaishnavi Amuda

I am a student pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics at Monash University. With a strong foundation in data analysis, I am passionate about working in **consulting roles** where I can leverage data-driven insights to solve business challenges and improve decision-making processes.

I aspire to work with leading firms in the consulting industry, helping businesses unlock the full potential of their data to achieve their strategic goals.

Beyond my studies, I have several hobbies that keep me engaged and creative. I enjoy creating whimsical and lighthearted doodles in my free time, which allows me to relax and have fun with my drawings. I also love solving puzzles, especially Sudoku, dominoes, and word search, as they help keep my mind sharp. In my downtime, I unwind by watching some of my favorite sitcoms, and I also find joy in experimenting with new recipes and cooking delicious meals.

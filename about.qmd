## Vaishnavi Amuda

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Business Analytics at Monash University, equipped with a solid foundation in data analysis. My passion lies in consulting roles where I can harness data-driven insights to tackle business challenges and enhance decision-making processes. I aspire to collaborate with leading firms in the consulting industry, helping them unlock the full potential of their data to achieve strategic objectives.

Outside of academics, I enjoy various hobbies that spark my creativity. I love creating whimsical doodles, which provide a fun outlet for relaxation. Puzzles are another favorite pastime, particularly Sudoku, dominoes, and word searches, as they keep my mind sharp. During my downtime, I unwind by watching sitcoms and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
